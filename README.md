# AR-app-for-education
In this technology advanced world, everything is proceeding so why not education sector. 
Why we are still following old school methedology for studying? So our team came up with an interesting idea to incorporate AR into education sector.
Basically our app will scan and create a 3D model of any 2D picture it will encounter in textbooks. For instance, someone scan a picture of lungs, 
so a 3D model of lungs will pop-up which will underline the important parts of the organ helping in better understanding of the topics for students. 
At this level we have just incorporated 4 models namely brain,heart,robot and building. 
We have used Unity 3D engine for detection of image targets,Vuforia SDK for compiling our database and 3DsMax for making the 3D models. 
We have uploaded the images,3D models,code for better understanding of the project.
