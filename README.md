Introduction
------

- In this technology advanced world, everything is proceeding so why not education sector. 
- Why we are still following old school methedology for studying?
- So our team came up with an interesting idea to incorporate AR into education sector.
- Basically our app will scan and create a 3D model of any 2D picture it will encounter in textbooks. 
- For instance, someone scan a picture of lungs, so a 3D model of lungs will pop-up which will underline the important parts of the organ helping in better understanding of the topics for students.
- At this level we have just incorporated few models namely brain,heart,robot and building. 
 
 Software used
-------
- Unity 3d engine
- Vuforia SDK
- 3ds Max

Application
----
1.  Complete AR experience for the students to help them visualize things in real life.
2.  Completely User-Friendly and Realistic User interface.
3. Easy to visualize and make things living.
4. Making learning much Entertaining and Realistic than ever before.

Aim & Future
-----

- We want to increase our database and scale our app in particular fields like human anatomy.
- We also want to incorporate machine and deep learning so that different images of same object can be detected.
- Scaling our app in educational field.

Scripts
-----
- NewBehaviousScript.cs-This code was basically for zooming in and zooming out.
- .mat and .fbx - This contains the 3d-model files.

Usage
------

- Download Unity 3d software and install unity hub.
- Install My project 4 from our github repository.
- Download all the images from repository.
- Open the project and scan the image.
- 3d models will pop up.
- For running the app in mobile, switch on the developer setting.
- Our app runs on higher version of Android.

Branches
--------
- main- It contains the readme file of our project.
- master - This contains all the image and 3d model files used in the project.
- finalproject - It contains the final unity project file and also the descriptive presentation of our project.
